# jinghuayao_leetcode_solutions

My python solutions to leetcode problems. The leetcode webpage is https://leetcode.com/
I made an effort to solve these problems in an easy-to-understand way, emphasize code 
readability rather than pursuing shortest possible solutions, and emphasize fundamental data structures
and algorithms rather than pursuing technicalities. In Chinese, we can summarize the above princiles as follows:

                            宁拙毋巧， 宁朴勿华.

As I am using python to writing the solutions, I hope the above
principles aligns to "The Zen of Python":

The Zen of Python, by Tim Peters

Beautiful is better than ugly.

Explicit is better than implicit.

Simple is better than complex.

Complex is better than complicated.

Flat is better than nested.

Sparse is better than dense.

Readability counts.

Special cases aren't special enough to break the rules.

Although practicality beats purity.

Errors should never pass silently.

Unless explicitly silenced.

In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess.

There should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it.

Although that way may not be obvious at first unless you're Dutch.

Now is better than never.

Although never is often better than *right* now.

If the implementation is hard to explain, it's a bad idea.

If the implementation is easy to explain, it may be a good idea.

Namespaces are one honking great idea -- let's do more of those!

I also acknowlegde the contributions of the leetcode.com for problems and of the leetcode coders for their contributions.
